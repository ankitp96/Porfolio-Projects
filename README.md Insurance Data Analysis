Insurance Data Analysis and Claim Incident Analysis
Overview
This Power BI project centers on the analysis of insurance data and claim incidents. The dataset comprises 1,000 individual claims, with the main objective being to present insights into insurance coverage and incidents. It includes 40 distinct attributes for each claim, organized into four key categories: insured individual details, policy information, incident descriptions, and the characteristics of the involved vehicle.

Project Goals
The key objectives of this Power BI project are:
•	Analyze the occurrence and distribution of fraudulent claims within the dataset.
•	Identify patterns or factors that suggest an increased probability of fraud in insurance claims.
•	Examine the relationship between various attributes and the likelihood of fraud.
•	Visualize key characteristics of insured individuals, policy details, and incident descriptions.
•	Provide insights into claim amounts and the distribution of claims across different categories.
•	Detect trends or patterns related to the timing and location of incidents.
Data Analysis and Visualization
This project leverages Power BI to deliver a range of interactive visualizations and dashboards. The visualizations and analyses may include:
•	Bar charts showing the distribution of occupations and education levels based on the number of claims and claim amounts.
•	Pie charts illustrating the breakdown of claim numbers and their corresponding amounts.
•	Line charts exploring the relationship between age and the number of claims.
•	Time series charts to examine trends and incident frequency over time.
•	Gauges to display claim amounts and the distribution of claims across different categories.

Conclusion
The Insurance Data Analysis and Claim Incident Analysis Power BI project offers valuable insights into insurance claim data, with an emphasis on fraud detection and understanding claim characteristics. By examining various attributes and visualizing trends, the project seeks to help insurance professionals identify potential fraud and enhance overall claim management practices.
